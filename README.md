A nice OpenStreetMap-based iOS map app. Tiles using MapBox.

The major feature is a search interface that behaves the way I want :P That means:

- *No more surprising map jumps.* Searches are done on the part of the map you're looking at right now, and if there's no hit there, instead of just jumping abruptly to another continent with some random search hit, it presents a list of choices. 
- *Continuous searches.* The search term is an active search, so when you move the view the search is performed again.
- *Pre-defined searches.* Built in categories like restaurants, parking, etc, so you don't have to try to figure out the correct term to use for the common cases.
